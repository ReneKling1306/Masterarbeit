                                   DEFINITIONS

          "This License" refers to version 1 of the AII Non-commercial License.
                            
          "Licensor" means the rights holder who has licensed one or more 
        works under these terms and conditions.

          "Licensed Material" means the copyright-protected artistic or literary

        for Artificial Intelligence Purposes.
            
                                     SCOPE

          Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor 
        grants the Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, 
        non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use the Licensed Material for
        Artificial Intelligence Purposes.

          The rights granted under this License may not be claimed for uses 
        other than Artificial Intelligence Purposes.

          The license terms defined in this License apply exclusively for Artificial 
        Intelligence Purposes.

                                  CONDITIONS
           
          The exercise of the licensed rights is subject to the following 
        conditions:

          A. Non-commercial:

            1. The Licensee may use the Licensed Material solely for Artificial 
            Intelligence Purposes that have no commercial intent.

            2. All uses in which intermediate or final products are intended to 
            generate commercial benefits or financial compensation are considered 
            commercial.

                                  TERMINATION

          This License is valid for the duration of the copyrights and similar other 
        rights licensed here. If the Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this 
        License, all rights granted under this License terminate.
                              
          If the rights to use the Licensed Material have been terminated, they will
        be reinstated if:

            1. the violation is corrected within 30 days of discovery; or

            2. the Licensor explicitly permits the reinstatement of the license.
            
          The use of this License does not prevent the Licensor from taking legal action 
        against the Licensee in the event of an infringement at his own discretion.
