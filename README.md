# AI Image Licensing Website

## Description

This project was developed as part of a Master's thesis that focuses on creating a new licensing model to give creators more control over how their images are used for AI training. 
It includes a Flask-based website that provides information about the licences and allows users to select a licence and embed it in the metadata of their images.
In addition, it includes portable software applications for Windows, Linux, and macOS that allow for local license selection and insertion.
